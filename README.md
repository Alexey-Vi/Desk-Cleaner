# Desk-Cleaner

# About

This project was primarely made to begin using & learning git, along with having a project to learn from.
Originally this was a script written to maintain clean work stations on shared computers at work, now it 
is remodeled into its own generic public project.

# What is this for?

This program is mainly maid for shared stations or for people who want an easier way to handle cleaning temp files from various folders.
With this, you may create and save templates of which files & folders you'd like various folders to contain, and with a click of a button
delete all the clutter that piled up over time.

This is still a work in progress, so feel free to give feedback on which parts to improve on.

# Features

* Creation of templates based on existing files in folder.
* Overwrite template files with a different folder/set of files.
* Deletion of templates
* Smart cleaning -  After cleaning a folder, you are able to enable a check for if the template holds more files than the actual files in the folder.
                    If its the case, a prompt will appear asking whether or not you would like to overwrite the template file with the actual files.

# How to run with exe

Simply download the exe file and place it wherever you'd like to keep the project files.
The app will automatically create an appropriate log file and json file containing all the templates.
