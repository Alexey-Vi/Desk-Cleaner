# Desk-Cleaner

# About

This project was primarely made to begin using & learning git, along with having a project to learn from.
Originally this was a script written to maintain clean work stations on shared computers at work, now it 
is remodeled into its own generic public project.

# What is this for?

This program is mainly maid for shared stations or for people who want an easier way to handle cleaning temp files from various folders.
With this, you may create and save templates of which files & folders you'd like various folders to contain, and with a click of a button
simply delete all the clutter that piled up over time.

This is still a work in progress, so feel free to give feedback on which parts to improve on.

# How to use?

* Simply run the program, and it will create its own DB file wherever you run the this from.
* Once running, create your own templates with whichever names you desire, but make sure to have the folders cleared before saving it,
  otherwise the clutter will be saved along with the files you wish to maintain.
* If you accidentally saved a template along with the clutter files, you may edit your template and remove the files you dont wish to save.
    - Note that currently the edit function only supports removing files or overwriting templates entirely. No addition of files at this time.
* Whenever you're ready to clean all the saved folders from clutter, simply press the 'Run Cleaner' button at the top.
* Wish to remove a template from the cleaning cycle? Use the 'Delete Template' button.
* The program also shows how many files are available to delete at any given time in the main window.
